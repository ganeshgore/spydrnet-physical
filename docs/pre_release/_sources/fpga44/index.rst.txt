Physical Design for 4x4 FPGA
-----------------------------

This tutorial explains a simple 4x4 FPGA design using OpenFPGA and a ``SpyDrNet-Physical`` design flow.


Architecture detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will consider a 4x4 Homogeneous FPGA with a 4-input LUT and a single FlipFlop as 
a logic element and eight logic elements per logic block. 
Input to every logic element is passed through a fully populated crossbar,
which can reroute any incoming CLB signal to any logic element port.
The following figure illustrates the structure of an FPGA tile.

Generating Netlist from OpenFPGA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenFPGA works based on the project structure (which is referred to as a task in OpenFPGA),
which means for generating a netlist, 
you need to create a task and configure all the required parameters. Q
A sample task is provided in the ``${REPOSITORY_ROOT}/examples/homogeneous_fabric`` directory.
Some of the essential files are described below

- **FPGA44_Task/arch/k6_N10_tileable.xml**: VPR architecture XML file, this describes the FPGA architecture
- **FPGA44_Task/arch/k6_N10_openfpga.xml**: OpenFPGA architecture XML file maps various physical cells to the described FPGA architecture 
- **FPGA44_Task/config/task_generation.conf**: OpenFPGA task file, it consists of various variable assignement
- **FPGA44_Task/generate_fabric.openfpga**: OpenFPGA script file, which lists the sequence of commands to generate FPGA fabric (Please read comments in the file for more information)
