Physical Design for 4x4 FPGA
-----------------------------

This tutorial explains a physical design of 4x4 homogeneous FPGA using ``OpenFPGA`` and 
a ``OpenFPGA-Physical`` design flow.


Directory Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. TODO Add some more contnent explaining what is this directory structure

We will use the following directory structure as a part of this project 
`OpenFPGA-Tapeout-Template <https://github.com/ganeshgore/openfpga-physical>`_

more information on directory strcture is here :ref:`openfpga_physical_directory_structure`.

Architecture detail
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this tutorial, we will consider a 4x4 homogeneous FPGA architecture a 4-input LUT and a single flipflop as 
a logic element and eight logic elements per logic block (AKA K4N8 architecture). 
Input to every logic element is passed through a fully populated crossbar,
which can reroute any incoming CLB signal to any logic element port.
The following figure illustrates the structure of an FPGA tile.

Generating Netlist from OpenFPGA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenFPGA works based on the project structure (which is referred to as a task in OpenFPGA),
which means for generating a netlist, 
you need to create a task and configure all the required parameters.
Please refer to the OpenFPGA documenation `Getting Started`_ and `OpenFPGA Shortcuts`_ for more detail.
A sample task is provided in the ``${REPOSITORY_ROOT}/examples/homogeneous_fabric`` directory.
Some of the essential files provided in this directory are:

- **FPGA44_Task/arch/k4_N8_tileable.xml**: VPR architecture XML file, this describes the FPGA architecture
- **FPGA44_Task/arch/k4_N8_openfpga.xml**: OpenFPGA architecture XML file maps various physical cells to the described FPGA architecture 
- **FPGA44_Task/config/task_generation.conf**: OpenFPGA task file, it consists of various variable assignement
- **FPGA44_Task/generate_fabric.openfpga**: OpenFPGA script file, which lists the sequence of commands to generate FPGA fabric (Please read comments in the file for more information)

To generate the verilog netlist from the existing architecture files, please run the
following command. It creates ``FPGA44_Verilog`` directory, which contains the 
original verilog netlist generated by the OpenFPGA tool.
