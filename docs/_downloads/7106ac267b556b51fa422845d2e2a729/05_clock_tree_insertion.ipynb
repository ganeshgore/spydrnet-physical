        "\n# Two layer H-Tree insertion in 4x4 FPGA \n\nThis example demonstrates how to insert H-Tree in tileable FPGA grid.\n\nIn this example we try to implement 2-layer HTree in 2x2 FPGA grid.\nFirst we create 2 different connection patterns to implement on each level of\nthe clock tree, and then embed these pattern using ``create_ft_ports`` and \n``create_ft_connection`` methods. \n\n.. Note: the dotted line indicates that the connection is either coming from \n   upper layer or going to lower layer.\n\n<img src=\"file://../../../../examples/OpenFPGA/clock_tree/_clock_tree_connections_l0.svg\" width=\"220px\">\n\n<img src=\"file://../../../../examples/OpenFPGA/clock_tree/_clock_tree_connections_l1.svg\" width=\"220px\">\n\n<img src=\"file://../../../../examples/OpenFPGA/clock_tree/_clock_tree_connections.svg\" width=\"220px\">\n"
