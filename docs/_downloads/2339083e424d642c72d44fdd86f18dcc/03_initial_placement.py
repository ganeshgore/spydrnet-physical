=================================================
Render Placement information from Verilog netlist
=================================================

This example demonstate how to render FPGA Tile using ``FloorPlanViz`` class
User can provide external script to render tiles, by default the rendering is
based on ``initial_placement`` class.

This script can be used for shaping and placement of the modules before place and route.
